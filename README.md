# Data-Analysis-and-Modelling-of-Diamond-Dataset
Data Analysis is the process of determining the important and useful information from the data sets by doing certain operations 
like Scrub the data, Explore the data, Model the data, Interpret the data. The information obtained from Data Analysis 
should help in business or organization decision makings. 
Diamonds are precious and hardest stones among the gemstones.Diamonds are beautiful gemstones. 
They are symbols of love, romance, and commitment, so people use them on their special days like engagement [1].
Diamonds are rare as they are formed under high pressure deep under the earth's crust so diamonds are very costly compared to 
other gemstones. Even though they are very costly people are very crazy to buy them. 
In order to know the reason behind why diamonds are costlier and what factors affect the diamond prices led me to choose
the Diamond dataset. The diamond data set contains information about more than 50k thousand diamonds. 
As a beginner in the Data Science feild working with such a good number of samples will lead me to come across many challenges 
and enhance my knowledge.
